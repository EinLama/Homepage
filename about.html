        <h1 class="title">About Tobias</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
            Software developer from Cologne, Germany
        </p>

        <p>When I was a child, I snuck into my brothers room to secretly
            play games
            on his C64. He didn't like that. Which teenager would accept his little brother using his expensive tech
            without asking for permission? Also, I had no idea what I was doing. But still, this computer fascinated me
            for
            some reason. When I eventually found out that you can write programs that can support
            people solve hard, boring and repetitive tasks (or help them recreate and learn)... Even though this is just
            fancy writing for helping others being lazy, I knew this is what I
            wanted to do!</p>

        <p>In the end, it turned out I would do just that. Solve those fancy problems - for a living!
            After a youth spent with lots of self-taught technologies and hobby
            projects, I eventually graduated in Media Computer Science (German: staatl. gepr. Informatiker Multimedia).
            Since then, I've done fullstack projects as well as pure frontend/backend
            work.
            I've been responsible for widely used smartTV applications and native Android apps. I've written my own
            games
            and have used various GUI frameworks (Qt, GTK+, Swing). Most of these technologies fascinated me for
            different
            reasons - and often left me in utter distress until it finally clicked. Even after more than a decade,
            there's much more to discover.</p>

        <p>The childhood fascination is what still drives me today. And I like to pass it on to the next generation.
            I've been involved with teaching non-programmers (including kids) how to program in my free time, and I've
            successfully educated apprentices during worktime over a three year
            period.</p>

        <h2>What I like</h2>
        <p>If I had to choose a favourite (general purpose) language, it would be
            <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>.
            It doesn't get in the way and enables me to quickly write clean software in a test-driven manner. It offers
            freedom for
            creative thoughts. If I had to choose a favourite editor, it would be <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
            -
            for similar reasons.
        </p>

        <p>Looking back, my favourite project was writing a smartTV application for live music video streaming. It was,
            in my
            opinion, one, if not <em>the</em> best smartTV application of the time. Doubt it? <a
                href="smarttv.html">Have a
                look!</a></p>

        <p>I'm convinced of the benefits of <strong>automated testing</strong> and proper, interesting
            <strong>documentation</strong>. I <em>actually</em>, really practice TDD whenever I can.
            It vastly improves the readability and modularity of my implementation. This technique is unfortunately
            widely underused.
        </p>


        <h2>What I don't like</h2>
        <p>I reject writing software which generates revenue mainly by selling advertisement. The ad-industry is a bane
            of
            the modern age and lives from selling personal data of end-users. I don't want to be a part of this immoral
            behaviour.</p>

        <p>I try to avoid finding problems for existing solutions. It should be the other way around.</p>

        <h2>Outside of work</h2>

        <p>Since I type all day, I want it to be nice and efficient. That's where my obsession with
            my <a href="https://www.zsa.io/planck">mechanical</a> <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/">keyboards</a>
            comes from. I also fully migrated to the <a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a> keyboard layout in 2021.
        </p>

        <p>When I'm not writing software, you can find me trying to improve my guitar play, picking up new physical
            activities (the most recent one being
            archery), traveling to distant countries or learning Japanese.</p>

        <blockquote>正直、最近あまり勉強しませんでした。</blockquote>

        <p>Still a gamer by heart, it seems a part of me never left my brothers C64.</p>

        <p>Lastly, I'm a whisky nerd. Like with technology, even after practicing a lot I still discover new exciting
            things. Only here it's new scents, tastes and experiences.</p>
