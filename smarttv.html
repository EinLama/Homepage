            Music video streaming application for TVs and the web
        </p>

        <p>This was the pinnacle of my multimedia work. An application in which you could watch music videos,
            personalized for you. Additionally, you could watch selected content such as new releases and music news.
        </p>

        <p>It had revolutionary features for its time and platform: You could log in on our website or the mobile app
            and control your TV application from there (just like Spotify does today). While you personalized your
            experience or searched for your favorite music videos, you were never disrupted from watching music videos.
            All menus and controls were rendered on top of the running stream. Back when Netflix still had their old
            static design, we already had this:</p>

        <figure class="image is-2by1">
            <img src="assets/app1.png">
        </figure>

        <p>The application was running on Samsung, LG, Philips (and many more) TVs, bundled as application
            package and marketed through their own app store. Sometimes it came preinstalled in the DACH
            region. Additionally, the app could be accessed via HbbTV which made it available for TVs not
            having any app ecosystem. Furthermore, it supported mouse input (some remote controls can behave
            like a pointer device), voice control-enabled search, and more. We even bundled the application
            for the Playstation 4, AndroidTV, Roku, Amazon FireTV and much more.</p>

        <figure class="image is-2by1">
            <img src="assets/app2.png">
        </figure>

        <p>All of these platforms had different needs for video codecs, input methods, data persistence (for
            storing user settings) and many more. The base technology to support most of these platforms is:
            a bit of HTML and a lot of JavaScript. In order to support all of their different requirements
            (sometimes XHTML, sometimes HTML5), I've built a Ruby on Rails webapp that would generate an
            asset bundle per platform, of course with i18n support and feature flags. During active
            development, you could run the Rails app in your browser and debug it like you would debug a
            regular SPA. Once the core development of a feature was done, I still had to verify the details
            on real hardware. Each brand and model behaved differently. Emulators were the exception.</p>

        <figure class="image is-2by1">
            <img src="assets/app3.png">
        </figure>

        <p>All in all, the core application with all its logic had around 500k lines of vanilla JavaScript.
            In a domain were debugging is very time-intensive, I've learned to write clean code in order to
            make the app run as stable as possible. Still, it included graceful atuomatic restarts in case
            of issues, troubleshooting advice for the end user, and more. I hope that the thousands of
            active users at the time enjoyed using the app as much as I did refining it.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, the app was terminated as its company was shut down in 2017.</p>
